# Refined CRM - client-side routing (React Router)
# Prevents 404 on refresh when app is served from Apache (e.g. cPanel).
#
# If the app is at the root of the domain (e.g. connect.refined-digital.co.za):
#   Keep RewriteBase / and the rule below as-is.
#
# If the app is in a subfolder (e.g. connect.refined-digital.co.za/crm):
#   Set RewriteBase /crm/
#   Change the last RewriteRule to: RewriteRule . /crm/index.html [L]
